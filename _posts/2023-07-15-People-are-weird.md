I do not understand people, they do not make so much sense to me. I always get baffled when dealing with humans, like why do you think and act like this? Almost all of them are stupid beyond repair. The general population seem to have chimp-like brain. I truly wonder if people are this bad or this is just the one of the effects of social media? To me, I am bounded by common sense, which I hate that it is called common because common is definitely not one of its attributes. Back to me, I almost worship logic, and this sometimes puts me in a variety of bad situations. Give, that humans, are barely logical. The emotional component of humans is something I do not like for how illogical it seems. I should not feel bad because of emotional effects that hold zero logical significance.

Why do people care about their image in other people's eyes? I barely get the part where you care about your image to the ones you admire and love, but why do you care about ``The people''? Why do people spend times and times trying to shape their images in the public Â eye, for people that you are almost guaranteed you will never meet? I just witnessed a person writing a 10-tweets thread trying to explain why do they put stickers of their favorite art on their bed... Just because someone criticized them of being childish, in a 10-tweets thread also... lol. I believe people should be above that, you should not care about these irrelevant voices that spew their opinions towards you, you are bigger and better than that. BE LOGICAL! EMBRACE LOGIC!

I do not judge people for their choices, one of the pillars of my personality is the respect I hold for the freedom of choice. However, I love, with passion, to criticize these choices, with myself and/or with a close friend. So I will try to enumerate some of these choices that I find stupid and illogical and are just a sign of mental backwardness:

- ***The fear of generalizations***: Anyone who always fear generalizations have almost no intellectual sovereignty, they are either intellectually dependent or intellectually eunuchs.
- ***The obsession with public image***: People should understand that they were never meant to be public figures, why the fuck would you act like one? Nobody cares, nobody gives a shit, you are living inside your own illusion, wake up!
- ***Work & money as life purposes***: One of the main issues of this modern society is that people lost their sense for purpose and meaning, and this lead to the soon-to-be collapse of the west. A weird phenomenon emerged where people seek money and work as their life purpose, and meaning. They do not see a meaning for their lives outside of these mortal, materialistic realms. Truly a pathetic sight to behold.
- ***The absence of family centrism***: People nowadays almost lost the meaning of family, marriage has turned into a luxury for fulfilling emotional needs without any sense of continuity and without the purpose of procreation. I do not respect men who do not see the importance of starting a family, and are only looking to work and get rich for no ultimate purpose.
- ***Lack of decisiveness***: You just can never trust and rely on these people.
- ***Shorts***: I hate men who wear shorts above their kneecap, I will never fully respect them.
- ***Engineers and Med students***: Do you really need a reason?

On a final note, I love writing! I am really mesmerizing this moment! I am writing so fast and dancing like I am on a piano writing a musical!
